# Three-Worlds of Welfare Capitalism
For my project "Revisiting the Three-Worlds of Welfare Capitalism," I explored the classification of modern welfare states through advanced analytical methods, particularly focusing on cluster analysis visualization to understand current welfare state regimes. Using data from "Measuring Socialism" and OECD databases, I addressed the question: Can welfare states today be categorized into the three welfare-state regimes identified by Esping-Andersen thirty years ago?

I employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality and identify patterns by transforming variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated principal components. This step was crucial for operationalizing complex concepts like decommodification and stratification, which define welfare regimes based on their levels of government intervention and social stratification.

Following PCA, I utilized Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) to categorize countries into clusters without needing to pre-specify the number of clusters. This method revealed three distinct clusters, suggesting a contemporary division of welfare states that aligns with Esping-Andersenâ€™s original typology of liberal, conservative-corporatist, and social-democratic regimes. The clusters were determined based on factors such as government expenditure, labor market protections, private expenditures, and social policy efforts, indicating a nuanced understanding of how modern welfare states can be classified.

The results highlighted the enduring relevance of Esping-Andersen's typology, with countries clustering around the three identified welfare regimes. This clustering not only validated the theoretical framework but also provided insights into the evolution of welfare states in response to challenges like globalization and demographic changes.

In conclusion, this project demonstrated my ability to apply complex data analysis techniques to social science questions, effectively using PCA and HCPC for cluster analysis visualization. This approach offered a nuanced understanding of the welfare state dynamics, contributing to the broader discourse on welfare state classification and its implications for social policy and governance.
